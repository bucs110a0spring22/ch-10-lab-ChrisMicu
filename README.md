### [Assignment Description](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kFLQs7Lepb8hcYOrZq5scmRmdcNkIwWZ6Kb85_0bCVY/edit?usp=sharing)

***
Replace anything surrounded by the `< >` symbols._

## SUMMARY:
 You are the turtle and you have the fight the enemies. You use the arrow keys to move and you have a total of 10 health which is displayed everytime your attack fails. The enemies move around and can very easily kill you as their attack damage is high.
#### Unique Feature
The unique feature I added although it does not completly work was that you can also win by saving the princess. The way to save the princess is to simply touch her however you still have to dodge the moving enemies which can be difficult.

## GRACE DAYS
Grace days used for this assignment: 2

Grace days remaining: 2/5

## KNOWN BUGS AND INCOMPLETE PARTS:
 The princess does not appear on the screen. I do not know if it is because of the picture I used from the internet or what not but if you make the screen for the game big and move all the way to the right side and then start to go down you end up hitting the invisible princess and win.

## REFERENCES:
None

## MISCELLANEOUS COMMENTS:
I was tight on time hence the bugs and the late submission I am sorry.
